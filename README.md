# SpaceBrix
Formerly called "IO"
A retro-style game for iOS written in Swift (using SpriteKit)

Inspired by such masterpieces as Flappy Bird and Swing Copter.
Did you know that there were bricks in space? NO? Bet youâ€™re excited now that you do!

The objective is to avoid the bricks by steering the space ship (accelerometer) and slowing it down (tap and hold).
The ship moves by itself. It is quite fast.

Note: This game uses CoreMotion, so it's definitely not simulator-friendly.

Note #2: There are probably no bricks in space. 

Note #3: Several features still coming up.
